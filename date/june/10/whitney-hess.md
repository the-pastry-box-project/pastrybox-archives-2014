I am unwritten, can’t read my mind, I’m undefinedI’m just beginning, the pen’s in my hand, ending
unplanned Staring at the blank page before you Open up the dirty window Let the sun illuminate the words that
you could not find Reaching for something in the distance So close you can almost taste it Release your
inhibitions Feel the rain on your skin No one else can feel it for you Only you can let it in No one else, no
one else Can speak the words on your lips Drench yourself in words unspoken Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins The rest is still unwritten

— Natasha Bedingfield
